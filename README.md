# Homework Programing 2 ITLA
Welcome! ðŸ‘‹
In this space, you'll find my projects and practices from the Programming II course, where I primarily develop APIs using architectures such as N-Layer and Onion Architecture.

This repository reflects my focus on building structured, clean, and scalable applications, applying principles of separation of responsibilities and good development practices. Among the concepts you'll see applied:

ðŸ”„ Creation and consumption of RESTful APIs

ðŸ§  Layer separation (Data, Business, Presentation Layers)

ðŸ§± N-Layer and Onion Architectures
